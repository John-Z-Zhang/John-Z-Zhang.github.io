## About Me
I am a third-year B.S. candidate in [Mechanical Engineering](https://www.me.gatech.edu/) with a minor in [Computing & Intelligence](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/content/minor-computing-intelligence) at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/). I am doing undergraduate research in Robotics with the [LIDAR Group](http://lab-idar.gatech.edu/) advised by [Dr. Ye Zhao](https://sites.google.com/site/yezhaout). I will be joinging [Cummins Inc.](https://www.cummins.com/) as a Software Development Engineering Intern during summer 2021 to work on electric and hybrid vehicle control algorithms. 

I am currently looking for PhD programs in Robotics and Computer Science starting in Fall 2022. I am broadly interested in expanding the boundaries of robot capabilities through intelligent planning, control, and learning.
